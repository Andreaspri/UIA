        <p>We value your privacy, and require your consent to store any data you decide to share with us. To keep things simple and straight to the point, this involves any information you enter into your account and any meeting you book with your groups. Essentially any data that we at UNIMEET require to keep the page operating to its intents.</p>
        <p>Sadly we use a database that is unable to encrypt your data, and as such you should only use this service if you agree to us storing your information in an unencrypted format. That said, we do not store any personal sensitive information, unless recovered by proxy from your own calendar that you must share with us for our services to operate.</p>
